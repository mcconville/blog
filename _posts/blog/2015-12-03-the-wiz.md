Really liked NBC's ['The Wiz Live'](http://www.nbc.com/the-wiz-live) tonight, so I thought I'd take a quick look on social media to see how people reacted. 

I've been experimenting with [Insights For Twitter on IBM Bluemix](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/Twitter/index.html) and used the [Decahose](https://gnip.com/sources/twitter/) which offers a 10% glimpse of sampled Tweets over a time period. There were 108285 tweets for #TheWiz ... which means in reality there were over a million of them all told - by 11pm EST! Impressive. Big Data!

So I loaded the Tweets into [Watson Analytics](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/watson-analytics/) which is a quick, fun way to explore data visually and with natural language. I reduced the size to 60,000 tweets for sampling in Watson Analytics. 

Here are a few stats - these are quick, and based on the sample set at around 11pm EST:

Tweets by state:

By Twitter Client ( Aqua green is Twitter for iPhone, Lime green - Twitter for Android, Blue - Twitter for web ):

Tweets by gender ( women in blue, men in green )
