Somehow I ended up a citizen of three amazing countries. I'm writing this post to say thanks for that, and to note down the impressive UX of applying for a new UK passport.

As a citizen of Canada, Ireland and the UK, I'm lucky, and very conscious that there are many around the world who would sacrifice a lot, just to be a citizen of any one of these countries.

Growing up in troubled Northern Ireland, I didn't always feel lucky. I'm sure admitting that even now offends some people. There was bitterness from both sides of the divide that I can still feel vividly decades later. It was hard for me to feel proud of being either Irish or British.

It has taken my lifetime to recognize the beautiful aspects of my origins and culture. I think a lot of people take time to piece their own jigsaw together. Yet, as peaceful as Northern Ireland miraculously is at the moment, there are still individuals within it who cling to the divide. Peace there is delicate, and vulnerable to the decisions made for Brexit.

#### A new UK passport

I made my own personal Brexit a long time ago, when I decided to make a life in Canada. And I feel that I belong here. I hope and wish that we can all experience a definite feeling of geographically, and culturally belonging. Although I think it might be time to move away from Ottawa, and think about the warmer West Coast of Canada. I love Ottawa, but the winters are really taking a toll on me now.

After settling here in Canada, I've exclusively traveled with my Canadian passport. I am on my second edition now. I haven't renewed my UK passport since it expired six years ago. But recently, a series of events led me to needing it again.

Our UK Nortel pensions were transferred finally in 2018 - 10 years after Nortel was dissolved. This was a catalyst for revisiting my life in the UK before moving. At points during the 2018, I needed my NI number, birth certificate, and then finally for a few remaining things I needed to prove that I was a UK citizen still.
