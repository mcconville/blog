It feels doubly lucky for me this month to fulfill a dream in traveling to Colombia, South America, AND sharing a passion project with the [developer community there at JSConf Colombia, Medell√≠n](http://jsconf.co/).

I'm going to present some project work that visualizes the psychology of an artist's lyrics, while experimenting with an emerging CSS and Javascript technology known as Houdini.

A couple of years ago I saw [Coldplay perform live](https://coldplay.com/video/viva-la-vida-live-in-sao-paulo/) in New York. I was blown away by the concert so much, that I booked to see them again a few weeks later on the same tour.

The combination of color, light and sound made the concert very different from any I'd been to before. Each person in the crowd had a gadget called a 'Xyloband' on their wrists that lit up and pulsated various colors and patterns in sync with the music. When scaled across 60,000 people in a dark stadium, it amplified emotions and felt intoxicating.

The concert inspired me to doodle Coldplay throughout their career, for each album, and explore their lyrical changes too ( [like I did with David Bowie a few years ago](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-archive/2017/01/natural-language-analysis-of-david-bowie-personas/) ).

This time, I wanted to stretch myself, and do something new in my approach. Coldplay use a lot of confetti at certain points when they perform. I wondered if I could use confetti in visualizing their lyrics data in some way.

I find it really interesting relating the psychology of the lyrics to life events of the artist, while also looking for clues as to why the music connects with me so much. It is interesting to see some life events influencing Coldplay's music.

This blog post is just a preview of some of the things I'll be talking about at the [JS Conf Colombia](http://jsconf.co/). I'll save the details, and my github repo for attendees, before writing more about it.

But as a taster, I will share my basic confetti Houdini paint repo. I used this repo to figure out how to make a custom confetti css class. During my presentation, I'll talk through how it works, and show how I use it in the project that I put together.
