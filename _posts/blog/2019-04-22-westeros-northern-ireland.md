Like millions of others, I am addicted to Game of Thrones. An added allure for me is that it is produced, and much of it is filmed in Northern Ireland, where I grew up.

I hadn't heard of some of the amazing, and naturally beautiful looking surroundings where they've filmed.

So - three sites that I am making a mental note to check out next time I'm home:

[Mussenden Temple](https://discovernorthernireland.com/Mussenden-Temple-and-Downhill-Demesne-Castlerock-Coleraine-P2928/)

[Dark Hedges](https://discovernorthernireland.com/The-Dark-Hedges-Stranocum-Ballymoney-P27502/)

[Cushendun Caves](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cushendun)

There's a really nice [Northern Ireland Tourism](https://discovernorthernireland.com/blog/northern-ireland-game-of-thrones-territory/) page about them.
