A few weeks ago, my teenage son Toby asked if I'd help him use my David Bowie lyrics personality analysis on the artist [Mac Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Miller).

I really didn't know anything about Mac Miller. I learned that he struggled with substance abuse, which was often referenced in his lyrics. On September 7, 2018, Miller died from an accidental drug overdose at his home, at the age of 26.

So, I set to work, building up the lyrics data with Toby. You can explore the project [here](https://mcconville.github.io/macmiller).

I realized that it is tricky to reuse any of the work I've been doing with my lyrics analysis, and this showed me that I needed to find a better way of scaling the idea for others to use if they want to.

### A new web component based project

In the past when I've built these lyrics analysis for [David Bowie](http://ziggy.mybluemix.net) or [Coldplay](http://coldplay.mybluemix.net), I've worked to design a unique kind of web app for each. I've drawn sketches of the different eras of the artist's careers, and then tried to design a storybook site around them.

I've realized that it doesn't scale well, so during the past few months, I've been working on a standard, reusable way of presenting the data. It is still a work in progress, but there is now a evolving set of tools and web components to more quickly create new analysis. I'm going to write more about that on the IBM Developer Blog soon.
