Last year [we made an experimental blockchain app](https://developer.ibm.com/code/2018/06/08/creating-a-blockchain-wellness-app-on-the-cloud/) that could be used at developer events, called [Kubecoin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kubecoin/id1369165644?mt=8).

Since then it has been used at 18 events in North America, and in Europe. I'm envious in that it was used quite a bit in Scandanavia last year. Particpants using it walked over 7 million steps, and 5km over 25 days of conferences. We had well over a thousand participants, and our idea was shared with 10s of thousands of others.

The app will be used again [this weekend in Istanbul](http://summit.devnot.com/index.html ). Lucky app, to travel so far.

Each time it is used at an event, there is a new set of merchandise that can be claimed. Rather than display mismatching photos of the objects, I started drawing the items to a similar palette, and style. You can see them above, most drawn quickly between meetings, or at the end of a day. Always a fun little project to return to. It is neat to see how the objects accrued on my Adobe Illustrator art boards.
