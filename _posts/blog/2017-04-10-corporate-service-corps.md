Late summer of last year I heard that I'd been accepted for an assignment with IBM's [Corporate Service Corps](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/responsibility/corporateservicecorps/). Here's a tweet from back then ...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/GinaTesla">@GinaTesla</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/IBMCSC">@IBMCSC</a> very grateful to be selected, and proud to be able to represent <a href="https://twitter.com/IBMCanada">@IBMCanada</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/IBMBluemix">@IBMBluemix</a> in an assignment :)</p>&mdash; Anton McConville (@antonmc) <a href="https://twitter.com/antonmc/status/765674793312092166">August 16, 2016</a></blockquote>

The CSC is a programme that sends a group of IBM employees to a developing community, on a month long assignment to use their skills helping an organisation there.

A couple of weeks ago, I heard more about my assignment. In August of 2017, I'm going to spend a month in Campinas Brazil ...

I've never been to Brazil, so I'm excited to be able to learn more about their culture, and continue learning more about South America.

I don't know yet what we'll be doing in Campinas, but I'm intrigued and excited to hear more about that too.

I've been thinking to blog a little more about the assignment as I learn more, and maybe make some Instagram stories when I'm there.

For now I have a mix of feelings ... excited about living and working in Brazil for a month, excited and hopeful that I can make a little bit of a difference for someone with my design and development skills, anxious about being away from home for a month, intrgigued to meet the others on my team.

For a long time now I've been trying hard to use what I've learned in industry to give back to others. With the project I worked on for [ShelterBox](http://www.hickory.ca/pages/detail.html?project=ShelterBox), with the [Random Hacks of Kindness](https://rhok.ca/) hackathons that I helped organize and hack at, even with the [advocacy projects](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/author/anton-mcconvilleca-ibm-com/) that I've worked on with Bluemix in recent years ... so this is another attempt/step.

I'm conscious that I'm benefitting a lot from this too ... I love traveling, I'm very interested in South America, and every problem I work on helps me improve too. 

Most of all, my goal with my CSC work is to give at least as much as I get from it.
