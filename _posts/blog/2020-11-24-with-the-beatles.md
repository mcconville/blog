One afternoon when I was a teenager, I picked up my brother's acoustic guitar, opened the ['Beatles Complete'](https://www.amazon.ca/Beatles-Complete-Chord-Songbook/dp/0634022296) songbook, and began learning 'Let It Be' because it only had four chords. It was the beginning of a lifelong love of playing guitar, as I worked my way up to 'Yesterday' with eleven chords ... and a lifelong love of the Beatles music.

I've been continuing to dig into the changing psychology of artists through their lyrics using [Watson Personality Insights](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/personality-insights/) and earlier this year worked on a Beatles project. As usual, I drew the Beatles in my own childish style using Adobe Illustrator, and ran personality insights on the band's lyrics.

With the help of my work colleagues, Steve and Bogdan, both Beatles fans, we identified five eras of Beatles music styles.
