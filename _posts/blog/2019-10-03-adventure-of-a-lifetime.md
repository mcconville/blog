It feels doubly lucky for me this month to fulfill a dream in traveling to Colombia, South America, and share a passion project with the developer community there in Medell√≠n.

I'm going to present some project work that visualizes the psychology of an artist's lyrics, while experimenting with an emerging CSS and Javascript technology known as Houdini.

A couple of years ago I saw Coldplay perform live in New York. I was blown away by the concert so much, that I booked to see them again a few weeks later on the same tour.

The combination of color, light and sound made the concert very different from any I'd been to before. Each person in the crowd had a gadget called a 'Xyloband' on their wrists that lit up and pulsated various colors and patterns in sync with the music. When scaled across 60,000 people in a dark stadium, it amplified emotions and felt intoxicating.

The concert inspired me to doodle Coldplay throughout their career, for each album, and explore their lyrical changes too ( like I did with David Bowie a few years ago ). This time, I wanted to stretch myself, and do something fresh with the approach. Coldplay also use a lot of confetti at certain points when they perform. I wondered if I could use confetti in visualizing their lyrics data in some way.

This blog post is just a preview of what I'll be talking about at the conference in Colombia. I want the project to be fresh for attendees there.

I find it really interesting relating the psychology of the lyrics to life events of the artist, while also looking for clues as to why the music connects with me so much. It is interesting to see some life events influencing Coldplay's music.

For now I will share my basic confetti Houdini repo. I used this repo to figure out how to make a custom confetti css class.
