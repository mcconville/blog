This year might be remembered as a turning point in the uptake in vegan food consumption, because of the phenomena known as 'Beyond Meat'.

Beyond Meat is a very processed, entirely plant based replacement for hamburgers, sausages and even ground beef in burritos. It is available in A&W, Mucho Burrito, Tim Hortons, Burger King and more restaurants as well as in all the grocery stores. It's a good news story. I think.

I was as excited as most others were to try it, and it is likeable - although when cooked it leaks a lot of something that seems next to impossible to clean out of my cast iron grill.

I eat other substitutes for everyday food too - I like cashew milk, tempeh bacon, and vegan cheese.
